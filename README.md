## 🩺 Project Overview

This project explores the classification of **heart rate audio signals** using a **custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture specifically designed for 1D time-series acoustic data. The goal is to improve classification accuracy on complex heart sound patterns through a novel representation and model training strategy.

The study is based on a **custom heart rate time series dataset** captured from real-world acoustic recordings, with preprocessing and exploratory analysis included.
